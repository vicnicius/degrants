# README

Some work on a set of Stacks smart contracts to build a grants DAO based on the [ExecutorDAO](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/executor-dao/tree/main/contracts), as part of the Hiro Hacks Hackathon. Unfortunately time was not of help on this challenge, so the work was incomplete. Still, there's a good set of tests and the key contracts are in place.
